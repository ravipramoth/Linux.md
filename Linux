=============
SED Command
=============

=> SED stands for stream editor

=> SED is used to process the data (substitute, delete, print, insert)

=> Using SED command we can perform operations on the file without opening the file.

=> SED is very powerful command in linux


# replace first occurance of linux keyword with unix
sed 's/linux/unix/' data.txt

# replace second occurance of linux keyword with unix
sed 's/linux/unix/2' data.txt

# replace 3rd occurance of linux keyword with unix
sed 's/linux/unix/3' data.txt

# replace all occurances of linux keyword with unix
sed 's/linux/unix/g' data.txt

# substitute and save changes in original file
sed -i 's/linux/unix/g' data.txt

# delete first line of the file
sed -i '1d' data.txt

# delete fourth line of the file
sed -i '4d' data.txt

#delete last line of the file
sed -i '$d' data.txt

# delete data from nth line to last line
sed -i 'n,$d' data.txt

Note: n is a number

# delete data from 5th line to 15th line
sed -i '5, 15d' data.txt

# print data from line number 10 to 20
sed -n '10,20p' data.txt

# insert data at 2nd line
sed '2i\i love india' data.txt

# insert data at last line
sed '$a\i am from ashokit' data.txt

=================
User Management
=================

=> Linux is a multi user based OS

=> Multiple users can acces single linux machine and can perform multi tasking at time.

Note: "ec2-user" is a default user in amazon linux vm. ec2-user having sudo priviliges.

=> Within one linux machine we can create multiple user accounts

=> when we create user account, for user one home directory will be created.

		ec2-user => /home/ec2-user

		john => /home/john

		smith => /home/smith

# create user
sudo useradd <uname>

# set password for user & update pwd for user
sudo passwd <uname>		

# display all users created
cat /etc/passwd

# swith user account
su <uname>

# navigate to current user home directory
cd ~

# Delete user
$ sudo userdel <uname>

# Delete user along with user home directory
$ sudo userdel <uname> --remove

# how to change username
$ sudo usermod -l <new-name> <old-name>



/etc/passwd: Contains general user information.
/etc/shadow: Contains hashed passwords and other security-related information.

===================================
Working with user groups in linux
===================================

=> When we create user in linux, for every user one user group also will be created with the given username.

# Display all groups in linux
$ cat /etc/group

# Create group in linux
$ sudo groupadd <group-name>

# Adding user to group
$ sudo usermod -aG <group-name> <username>

# Remove user from the group
$ sudo gpasswd -d <username> <group-name>

# display users belongs to a group
$ sudo lid -g <group-name>

# display user belongs to which groups
$ id <username>

# delete group
$ sudo groupdel <group-name>

# changing group name
$ sudo groupmod -n <new-name> <old-name>


=======================================================================================
Assignment : create new user and connect with linux vm using newly created user account
=======================================================================================



=> In linux, to enable password based authentication we need to modify below 2 files

		1) sudoers
		2) sshd_config

=================================
What is sudoers file in Linux
=================================

=> It is very important configuration file in linux machine.

=> Using this file we can control which user can run command as a superuser.

# print sudoersfile content
$ sudo cat /etc/sudeors

Note: We should be very careful while working with sudoers file. If we do any mistakes in sudoers file then system will be crashed.


########## Giving sudo previliges for user #######

# open sudoers file
$ sudo visudo

# Add below line
<username> ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

=> After making changes to close sudoers file =>  ( CTRL + X + Y + Enter)

========================================================
How to enable password based authentication for users ?
========================================================

=> In linux vm, by default passwordauthentication is no

=> If we want to connect with linux vm using username and password then we need to set that value as yes.

=> WE WLL MODIFY THIS IN "sshd_config" file.

# Display sshd_configurration file data
$ sudo cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# Open file
$ sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Note: Go to insert mode and enable pwdbasedauthentication as yes

# restart sshd service
# sudo systemctl restart sshd

Note : Now we can connect with linux vm using username and pwd

$ ssh username@public-ip
