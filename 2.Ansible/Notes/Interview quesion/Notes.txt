1. What is the arch of the Ansible? 

    Ansible follows a push-based architecture where the control node pushes configurations to managed nodes over SSH or WinRM without requiring an agent on the target machines.

2. can we have windows machines as control node ? 

    No, It must have linux/unix to be control / controller node ( Master / slave ) 

3. advantage of Ansible when compared to other automation tools ? 
    
    agent less tool -- we will be using SSH connection connection our manged nodes 
    simple and easy to learn -- uses YAML for playbooks which is human-readable 
    idempotent -- running the same playbook multiple times will not change the state of the system if it is already in the desired state

4. What is the difference between Ansible and Puppet?
    puppet will work agent mode 
    Ansible is agentless and uses SSH for communication, while Puppet requires an agent to be installed on each managed node.
5.   where is an configurations file located ?
    
    The main configuration file for Ansible is located at `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg` on the control node. This file can be customized to set various parameters for Ansible's operation. 

    to customized you can put working project directory 
    `ansible.cfg` file, which will override the global configuration settings.

    /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg -- system wide 
6. What is Ansible version  ? 



        ansible [core 2.10.3]

7. i want to copy a file to 100 servers using ansible how can i do that 

        ansible.builtin.file 
        src : 
        dest:

        forks -- > At a time how many playbook can controller run 
        by default it will run 5 host 
ansible-playbook <playbook-name> -f 15 

to change default values of fork you have add the changes in the 

ansible.cfg file
    inventory=/home/ansadmin/list
log_path = /home/ansadmin/ansible.log
callback_whitelist = slack
vault_password_file = /home/ansadmin/Linux.md/2.Ansible/Notes/Playbooks/devops.txt --> Planin txt - hashcorp valut / aws secerts manger 
forks = 15 -- system wide 

8. write a playbook to install a s/w 
 
    
    become_user: root 
    become: true
    become_mehtod: sudo 
    ansible.builtin.yum/package/apt/ -- 
9 . Whata are modules you have used? 

    copy, 
    debug 
    template 
    file
    lineinfile 
    blockinfile 
    package
    command 
    servie
    shell 
    fetch 
10 . difference between copy and fetch ?
        Copy used copy the files tp controller to managed nodes 
        fetch : from managed nodes to controller node 
11. difference between shell and command mondule 

    env varaible like PATH,HOME, && . ||, > < are not available in command module 

12 . Whare are verbosity level ? 
    tracing -> 
    Ansible supports different verbosity levels to control the amount of output generated during playbook execution. The levels range from 0 (default) to 4, with higher levels providing more detailed output.
    
    - `-v`: Verbose (level 1)
    - `-vv`: More verbose (level 2)
    - `-vvv`: Debug (level 3)
    - `-vvvv`: Connection debugging (level 4)
    - ` -vvvvv` : tranpost layer level  

13. I have senstive data and should not display at run time ? 

    no_log: true ( to avaoid printing senstive data in the screen ) we have to use it task level 

    
- name: Playbook using encrypted variable
  hosts: local
  gather_facts: false
  vars:
   my_password: "abc" 
  tasks:
    - name: Print the password (example only - avoid printing in real playbooks)
      debug:
        msg: "the password is {{ my_password }}"
      no_log: true
