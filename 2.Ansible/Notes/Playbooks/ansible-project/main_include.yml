# Purpose: Demonstrate include_tasks (dynamic) with OS family conditionals.
# Key concepts: dynamic loading at runtime; only matched file is loaded.
- name: Demo using include_tasks (dynamic)
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: true

  tasks:
    - name: Load RedHat-specific tasks dynamically
      include_tasks: tasks/redhat.yml
      when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == "RedHat"

    - name: Load Debian-specific tasks dynamically
      include_tasks: tasks/debian.yml
      when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == "Debian"


#  With include_tasks, only the matching file is loaded at runtime,
#  making it safer and more flexible.
