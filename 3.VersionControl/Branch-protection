What Are Branch Protection Rules ?

They are guardrails applied to important branches (e.g., main, master, develop) to prevent direct pushes, enforce reviews, and enforce quality checks before merging.
👉 Ensures stability, security, and code quality. 


🔹 Common Branch Protection Rules
1. Restrict Direct Pushes

Developers cannot push directly to main/master.

They must create a Pull Request (PR).
✅ Prevents accidental overwrites and bad code in production branches.


2. Require Pull Request Reviews

PRs must be approved before merging.

Example: At least 2 approvals required.
✅ Promotes peer review and avoids single-person mistakes.


Merge Conflict 


A merge conflict in a PR happens when Git cannot auto-merge because the same code was modified in different ways. To resolve, we manually edit the conflicted files, stage them, and commit. CI/CD pipelines usually block PR merge until conflicts are resolved.”
